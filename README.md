Repository for clox implementation, a compiler written in C for lox, a toy programming language.

## Getting started

The `src` directory conatins the source code in modules, `main.c` is also present which calls the main compiler.

Use the good ol' make for producing the compiler binary.
```bash
make
```

This is produce the `obj` directory with all the objects and compile it into the main program.

## Disclaimer

This work was made possible only because of [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/global-variables.html).

## Future Plans

Make your own toy programming language using LLVM and deploy it on a breadboard computer. Add support for listening to TCP sockets and finally host your website or the language documentation on it. Amazing isn't it?
